# AMSC808N

Welcome to my repository for [AMSC808N: Numerical Methods for Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/NumericalMethodsforDataScienceAndMachineLearning.html) taught by [Prof. Maria Cameron](https://www.math.umd.edu/~mariakc/)! 
The class was divided into the following four units (click on each to learn more about it!): 

1. [Optimization](https://github.com/ShashankSule/AMSC808N/tree/master/Optimization)
2. [Matrix Methods](https://github.com/ShashankSule/AMSC808N/tree/master/Matrix%20Methods)
3. [Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/ShashankSule/AMSC808N/tree/master/Dimensionality%20Reduction)
4. [Modeling with Random Graphs](https://github.com/ShashankSule/AMSC808N/tree/master/Graph%20Modeling)

I learned some cool stuff in this class--including [solving differential equations with a single layer neural network](https://github.com/ShashankSule/AMSC808N/tree/master/Problem%20Sets/PSET3) and [infecting a graph with a virus](https://github.com/ShashankSule/AMSC808N/blob/master/Final/Solutions%20to%20Problem%202.ipynb).
